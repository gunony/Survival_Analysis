## Installation and loading

R packages used :
-   'survival' =\> compute survival analyses
-   'survminer' =\> summarize and visualize the results of survival
    analysis.

```{r}
# install.packages(c("survival", "survminer"))
library("survival")
library("survminer")
```

The lung cancer dataset is available in the survival package. The
dataset is composed of the following data :

-   inst: Institution code
-   time: Survival time in days
-   status: censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
-   age: Age in years
-   sex: Male=1 Female=2
-   ph.ecog: ECOG performance score (from 0=active to 5=dead)
-   ph.karno: Karnofsky performance score (from 0=dead to 100=normal)
-   pat.karno: Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
-   meal.cal: Calories consumed at meals
-   wt.loss: Weight loss in last six months

Detail on ph. ecog and ph. karno :

```{r}
#data("lung") #load the dataset
head(lung) # look at the dataset

```

## Step 1 - Compute survival curves per sex with survfit()

The function survfit() is included in survival package. The Kaplan-Meier
estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival
function from lifetime data.

*S(t)* : the estimator of the survival function (the probability that
life is longer than t).

![](images/PictureKM.png){width="236"}

with :

*ti* : a time when at least one event happened,

*di* : the number of events (e.g., deaths) that happened at time *ti*

*ni* : the individuals known to have survived (have not yet had an event
or been censored) up to time *ti*

```{r}
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)  
# to get the split by gender otherwise replace by 'Surv(time, status) ~ 1'
print(fit)
```

### Access to the variables in the function survfit()

```{r}
str(fit)
```

The main arguments :

-   n: total number of observations in each curve (M/F).
-   time: the time points on the curve.
-   n.risk: the number of observations at risk at time t.
-   n.event: the number of events that occurred at time t.
-   n.censor: the number of censored observations at time t.
-   surv : estimate of survival at time t.
-   std.err : std error of the cumulative hazard
-   strata: counts nb of time points belong to each curve. Each curve is
    also given a name.
-   lower,upper: lower and upper confidence limit.

For more information enter in the console : ?survfit.object()

Remark on censored observations : An event of interest (death, relapse)
may not be observed during the study time. It produces a censored
observations (patient lost, ...).

```{r}
KMVariables <- data.frame(time = fit$time,
                  n.risk = fit$n.risk,
                  n.event = fit$n.event,
                  n.censor = fit$n.censor,
                  surv = fit$surv,
                  upper = fit$upper,
                  lower = fit$lower
                  )
KMVariables
```

### Make the graph of the function survfit()

```{r}
ggsurvplot(fit,
          pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE,
          risk.table = "abs_pct",  # absolute number and percentage at risk.
          risk.table.col = "strata", # Change risk table color by groups
          xlab = "Time in days",   # customize X axis label.
          break.time.by = 200,     # break X axis in time intervals by 200
          linetype = "strata", # Change line type by groups
          surv.median.line = "hv", # Specify median survival
          ggtheme = theme_bw(), # Change ggplot2 theme
          legend.labs = c("Male", "Female"),    # change legend labels.
          ncensor.plot = TRUE,      # plot the number of censored subjects at time t
          palette = c("orange", "grey"))
```

Explanation : X-axis represents the time in days. Y-axis gives the
probability of surviving. A vertical bar on the graph represents a
censored event. The median survival (50%) is 270 days for men and 426
days for women. Women seems surviving longer than men. It has to be
confirm with Logrank Test.

A p-value of 0.0013 shows an acceptable level of statistical
significance.

### The complete table of the survival curves

To look in detail the data.

```{r}
summary(fit)
```

## Step 3 - Comparison of the two survival curves with logrank test

Group 1 : Male

Group 2 : Female

Hypothesis :

-   H0 : Group 1 = Group 2

-   H1 : Group \<\> Group 2

The LOGRANK TEST is the method used to the two survival curves. The
function to use in R is survdiff()

```{r}
surv_diff <- survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
surv_diff
```

Explanation of the different components :

-   N : number of observations in each groups
-   observed : weighted observed number of events.
-   expected : weighted expected number of events.
-   Chisq : chisquare statistic for a test of equality.
-   the p-value corresponding to the Chisquare statistic.

THE P-VALUE OF 0.001 INDICATES THAT THE TWO GROUPS DIFFER IN SURVIVAL.

## Step 4 - Compute univariate Cox regression model

In univariate Cox regression only one factor is considered (in the example sex).
The function coming from survival package used for Cox method is : coxph().

```{r}
univ.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
summary(univ.cox) # to show the report
```
Explanations of the indicators : 
-   coef : this is the estimated coef Bêta form the Cox model.
-   exp(coef) : it is the Hazard Ratio (HR).
-   se(coef) : it is the std error of the coef Bêta.
-   z : z-score = coef/se(coef)
-   Pr(>|z|) : the p-value associated with the z-score.
-   lower/upper : it is the confidence interval of the HR.
-   Concordance : is a measure of the predictive accuracy (1=perfect prediction/0.5=random).


Make the associated graph

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(univ.cox,data=lung), 
           surv.median.line = "hv",
           break.time.by = 100,
           palette = "blue", 
           ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```



## Step 5 - Compute multivariate Cox regression model

This time we will compute the Cox method with 3 factors ; age, sex and ph.ecog

```{r}
multi.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + ph.ecog, data =  lung)
summary(multi.cox)
```
Remarks on the p-value :
  Only the p-value of the covariates 'sex' and 'ph.ecog' are acceptable (below 0.05).
  For the covariate 'age', the p-value is 0.23, too high.

Remarks on the HR :
  With a HR of 1.59, the 'ph.ecog' indicates a strong link with the increased risk of death. 
  At the opposite the HR of 'Sex' covariate =0.58 shows a strong link with the decreased risk of death.
  The covariate 'age' with a HR of 1.0 has no effect on the risk of death.
  

### Make the associated graph

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(multi.cox,data=lung),
           palette = "orange",
           surv.median.line = "hv",
           break.time.by = 100,
           legend.labs = c("age + sex + ph.ecog"),
           ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```
