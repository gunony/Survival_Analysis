## Installation and loading

R packages used : 
-   'survival' =\> compute survival analyses
-   'survminer' =\> summarize and visualize the results of survival analysis.

```{r}
# install.packages(c("survival", "survminer"))
library("survival")
library("survminer")
```

The lung cancer dataset is available in the survival package. The
dataset is composed of the following data :

-   inst: Institution code
-   time: Survival time in days
-   status: censoring status 1=censored, 2=dead
-   age: Age in years
-   sex: Male=1 Female=2
-   ph.ecog: ECOG performance score (from 0=active to 5=dead)
-   ph.karno: Karnofsky performance score (from 0=dead to 100=normal)
-   pat.karno: Karnofsky performance score as rated by patient
-   meal.cal: Calories consumed at meals
-   wt.loss: Weight loss in last six months

Detail on ph. ecog and ph. karno :

```{r}
#data("lung") #load the dataset
head(lung) # look at the dataset
```

## Step 1 - Compute survival curves per sex with survfit()

The function survfit() is included in survival package. The Kaplan-Meier
estimator is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival
function from lifetime data.

*S(t)* : the estimator of the survival function (the probability that
life is longer than t).

![](images/PictureKM.png){width="236"}

with :

*ti* : a time when at least one event happened,

*di* : the number of events (e.g., deaths) that happened at time *ti*

*ni* : the individuals known to have survived (have not yet had an event
or been censored) up to time *ti*

```{r}
fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)  
# to get the split by gender otherwise replace by 'Surv(time, status) ~ 1'
print(fit)
```

### Access to the variables in the function survfit()

```{r}
str(fit)
```

The main arguments :

-   n: total number of observations in each curve (M/F).
-   time: the time points on the curve.
-   n.risk: the number of observations at risk at time t.
-   n.event: the number of events that occurred at time t.
-   n.censor: the number of censored observations at time t.
-   surv : estimate of survival at time t.
-   std.err : std error of the cumulative hazard
-   strata: counts nb of time points belong to each curve. Each curve is
    also given a name.
-   lower,upper: lower and upper confidence limit.

Remark on censored observations : An event of interest (death, relapse)
may not be observed during the study time. It produces a censored
observations (patient lost, ...).

```{r}
KMVariables <- data.frame(time = fit$time,
                  n.risk = fit$n.risk,
                  n.event = fit$n.event,
                  n.censor = fit$n.censor,
                  surv = fit$surv,
                  upper = fit$upper,
                  lower = fit$lower
                  )
head(KMVariables)
```

### Make the graph of the function survfit()

```{r}
ggsurvplot(fit,
          pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE,
          risk.table = "abs_pct",  # absolute number and percentage at risk.
          risk.table.col = "strata", # Change risk table color by groups
          xlab = "Time in days",   # customize X axis label.
          break.time.by = 200,     # break X axis in time intervals by 200
          linetype = "strata", # Change line type by groups
          surv.median.line = "hv", # Specify median survival
          ggtheme = theme_bw(), # Change ggplot2 theme
          legend.labs = c("Male", "Female"),    # change legend labels.
          ncensor.plot = TRUE,      # plot the number of censored subjects at time t
          palette = c("orange", "grey"))
```

Explanation : X-axis represents the time in days. Y-axis gives the
probability of surviving. A vertical bar on the graph represents a
censored event.

The median survival (50%) is 270 days for men and 426 days for women.
Women seem surviving longer than men. This affirmation has to be
confirmed with a Logrank Test. This test will allow to confirm or not
that the two distributions have the same distribution curve.

A p-value of 0.0013 shows an acceptable level of statistical
significance.

### The complete table of the survival curves

To look in detail the data. Otherwise do not run the Chunk.

```{r}
# summary(fit)
```

## Step 3 - Comparison of the two survival curves with Logrank test

Group 1 : Male

Group 2 : Female

Hypothesis :

-   H0 : Group 1 = Group 2

-   H1 : Group \<\> Group 2

The LOGRANK TEST is the method used to the two survival curves. The
function to use in R is survdiff()

```{r}
surv_diff <- survdiff(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
surv_diff
```

Explanation of the different components :

-   N : number of observations in each groups
-   observed : weighted observed number of events.
-   expected : weighted expected number of events.
-   Chisq : chisquare statistic for a test of equality.
-   the p-value corresponding to the Chisquare statistic.

Comments : a p-value of 0.001 reinforces confidence in the rejection of
the null hypothesis and suggests that the differences observed between
the two groups are very unlikely to be attributed to chance. The
previous affirmation concerning female and male surviving is confirmed.

## Step 4 - Compute univariate Cox regression model

In univariate Cox regression only one factor is considered (in the
example sex). The function coming from survival package used for Cox
method is : coxph().

```{r}
univ.cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)
summary(univ.cox) # to show the report
```

Explanations of the indicators :

-   coef : this is the estimated coef Bêta form the Cox model.
-   exp(coef) : it is the Hazard Ratio (HR).
-   se(coef) : it is the std error of the coef Bêta.
-   z : z-score = coef/se(coef)
-   Pr(\>\|z\|) : the p-value associated with the z-score.
-   lower/upper : it is the confidence interval of the HR.
-   Concordance : is a measure of the predictive accuracy (1=perfect
    prediction/0.5=random).

Comments : An HR of 0.58 suggests that, compared with the reference
group, the female group associated with 0.58 has a reduced risk of
events (e.g. death or disease progression).

A significantly low p-value, such as 0.00149, suggests a high
probability that the association between sex and risk of lung cancer is
not due to "chance".

Make the associated graph

```{r}
ggsurvplot(survfit(univ.cox,data=lung), 
           surv.median.line = "hv",
           break.time.by = 100,
           palette = "blue", 
           ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

## Step 5 - Compute multivariate Cox regression model

We will compute the Cox method with all factors ; age, sex, ph.ecog,
ph.karno, pat.karno, meal.cal, wt.loss and ph.ecog to see which factors
are pertinent to keep.

```{r}
multi.cox1 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno + pat.karno + meal.cal + wt.loss, data =  lung)
summary(multi.cox1)
```

Remarks : Only the p-value of the covariates 'sex', 'ph.ecog' and
'ph.karno' are acceptable (below 0.05). The p-values of the other
covariates are too high to be maintained in the following analysis.

We launch a new calculation with these three covariates.

```{r}
multi.cox2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno, data =  lung)
summary(multi.cox2)
```

Comments : With a p-value of 0.25, the covariate "ph.karno" is no more
relevant. A new computation with sex and ph.ecog is run.

```{r}
multi.cox3 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog, data =  lung)
summary(multi.cox3)
```

Comments on the HR :

With p-values lower than 0.05, the two covariates are relevant.

Concerning the covariate 'sex' the HR shows a different risk between
male and female. Female have a lower death risk or lower progression of
the cancer compared to male. This is confirmed with the survival curve
in step1.

Concerning the 'ph.ecog' covariate, the HR of 1.6282 means an increase
of the risk associated with a growth of the 'ph.ecog' indicator. An
increase of 1 unit of the indicator 'ph.ecog', the risk associated
increase of 62.82%

## Step 5 - Validate the number of covariates

5.1 Use of Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)

It is a statistical test used to compare the goodness-of-fit of two
nested models based on their likelihood functions.

We are going to compare the Cox Regression with 3 models : - sc1 = 'sex'
only - sc2 = 'sex' + 'ph.ecog' - sc3 = 'sex' + 'ph.ecog' + 'ph.karno'

```{r}
lung <- na.omit(lung)  # Remove any rows with missing values
sc1 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex  , data =  lung)
sc2 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog  , data =  lung)
sc3 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno, data =  lung)
anova(sc1, sc2, sc3)
```

Comments: with a p-value of 0.000027, the second model, where we add
ph.ecog improves the quality of the second model compare to the first
one. However adding the 'age' does not offer a better model, as the
p-value is 0.1016 (above the level of 0.05).

5.2 Use the AIC model

```{r}
lung <- na.omit(lung)  # Remove any rows with missing values
sc1 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex  , data =  lung)
sc2 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog  , data =  lung)
sc3 = coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + ph.ecog + ph.karno, data =  lung)
fifi=list(sc1=sc1, sc2=sc2, sc3=sc3)
sapply(fifi, AIC)
```

Comments : We can see an decrease of the indicator between the first
model 1 and model 2. The improvement is not so string between the third
model and the second model.


## STEP 5 - PREDICTION

Predict and plot the survival curves at the age of 35, 55 and 85 for
male only.

```{r}
cox_age=coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex  , data =  lung)
pred = survfit(cox_age, newdata = data.frame(age=c(35,55,85), sex=c(1,1,1)))

ggsurvplot(pred, data=lung,
          pval = FALSE, conf.int = FALSE,
          risk.table = FALSE,  # absolute number and percentage at risk.
          risk.table.col = "strata", # Change risk table color by groups
          xlab = "Time in days",   # customize X axis label.
          break.time.by = 100,     # break X axis in time intervals by 200
          linetype = "strata", # Change line type by groups
          surv.median.line = "hv", # Specify median survival
          ggtheme = theme_bw(), # Change ggplot2 theme
          legend.labs = c("35", "55", "85"),    # change legend labels.
          ncensor.plot = FALSE,      # plot the number of censored subjects at time t
          palette = c("orange", "grey","cyan"))
```
